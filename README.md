# Deep-learning-Cortaderia-selloana

This project was implemented using nine different pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, Faster R-CNN ResNet50, Faster R-CNN ResNet101 and Faster R-CNN Inception-v2), depending on the pretended task (classification or object detection), along with three different weights (ImageNet, MSCOCO and iNaturalist).

In the script files there is only represented the DenseNet201 architecture with ImageNet weights, for the classification task, and the Faster R-CNN ResNet101 architecture with MS COCO weights, as these two pairs achieved the best results for our project. All analysis were perfomed using Google Colab.
